## Daily Report
Focused on understanding the project tasks and preparing the tools to be used.

## Obstacles
- There was a lot of flow of information that needs to be structured. (Gave a overwhelming feeling)
- Had some difficulties preparing VS Code for the project. (installing the needed extentions and adding my credentials)
- Understanding exactly how to properly conduct the tasks.

## Solutions
- Get more information from the product owner tomorrow morning and break tasks up into sub-tasks.
- Found the correct youtube video which guided me through the process
- This will also be asked tomorrow during the meeting with the product owner

## Learnings
- I have learned at least how to use my credentials to login via VS Code.
- Found out that if the budget is passed it will be on my own account.
- Deadline must be made / planned for the end of the V1.0 not the end of the whole project.
