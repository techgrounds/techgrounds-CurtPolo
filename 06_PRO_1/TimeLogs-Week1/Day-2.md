## Daily Report
I focused on really starting with the two first user stories and preparing my working enviorment using CDK on VS Code.

## Obstacles
- I had issues knowing where to begin.
- I had issues with creating the project enviorment. I did not understand the concept of all the information I had to fill in.
## Solutions
- decided to use ChatGPT to help guide me through the best possible start points and help me structure things much better.
- I encountered a guide video which helped me create a sample application template. This way I can just delete what is build on the template but keep the structure of it so I can build my own application.

## Learnings
- I found out that I can just make a new directory using the terminal on VS Code
- I found the following useful commands: 
 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
