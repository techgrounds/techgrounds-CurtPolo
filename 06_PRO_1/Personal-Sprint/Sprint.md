# Week 1

## Goal
My goal is to learn as much as I can about CDK and more importantly make my own version of the project infrastructure diagram.

## Methods
I will be watching some videos on YouTube in combination with working with ChatGPT to provide clarity when needed.

## Metrics
If I have enough information to be able to at least start with the base of the coding process I would consider it a good sprint

# Week 2

## Goal
To finally have a errorless working envioroment on AWS CDK and to have at least one functioning code that will be able to construct my VPCs, Availability zones and Transit gateway in a specified region.

I also need to update all the deliverable documents.

## Methods
In combination with ChatGPT and using key breakdown questions and videos on YouTube.

I will also look into locally testing AWS CDK applications in order to test their functionality without inquiering costs.

## Metrics
If I am able to test the code to deploy my VPCs in the eu-central-1 region, into AZ A and AZ B and have the main communication between the two happen on AZ A, I will consider this weeks sprint as a success.

# Week 3

## Goal
To be able to resolve issues I am having with my code when it comes to:

- Connecting my management server to my admin server
- Resolving TypeErros and Attribute Erros I am getting
- Resolve issues with my security group and NACL
## Methods
Try to break down each error code in multiple one by one and try to resolve them the same way.
## Metrics
If I can correct the errors to at least have a deployable code and manage to make a connection between the two servers I would consider it a success
# Week 4

## Goal
To be able to resolve issues I am having with my code when it comes to:

- Connecting my management server to my admin server
- Resolving Type errors and Attribute errors I am getting
- Resolve issues with adding a route to my transit gateway in my route table via code.
## Methods
Trying to re-write my code in a different way that would allow me more control of each section.

Using 3 different set of AIs to analyse my error codes one by one to try and get to a solution.
## Metrics
If I can just deploy my code with 0 Attribute, Type or deployment errors and manage to adjust my NACL and security groups to allow traffic of all my subnets, I would consider it success. Basically if I complete all the goals.
# Week 5

## Goal
My goal is to finish the following V1.0 tasks that are essential to V1.1
- Finish my KMS
- Fix and Test my auto-scaling group
- Fix and test my load balancer
- Change my admin server to a windows server
- RDP into my admin server
## Methods
- AWS documentations
- YouTube videos
- AIs just for guidance 
- Classmates
## Metrics
