# Week 1

## Goal
My goal is to learn as much as I can about CDK and more importantly make my own version of the project infrastructure diagram.

## Methods
I will be watching some videos on YouTube in combination with working with ChatGPT to provide clarity when needed.

## Metrics
If I have enough information to be able to at least start with the base of the coding process I would consider it a good sprint

# Week 2

## Goal
To finally have a errorless working envioroment on AWS CDK and to have at least one functioning code that will be able to construct my VPCs, Availability zones and Transit gateway in a specified region.

I also need to update all the deliverable documents.

## Methods
In combination with ChatGPT and using key breakdown questions and videos on YouTube.

I will also look into locally testing AWS CDK applications in order to test their functionality without inquiering costs.

## Metrics
If I am able to test the code to deploy my VPCs in the eu-central-1 region, into AZ A and AZ B and have the main communication between the two happen on AZ A, I will consider this weeks sprint as a success.
