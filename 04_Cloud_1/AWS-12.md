# Well Architected Framework
**The Well-Architected Framework (WAF) is a set of best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud.** The framework provides a consistent approach for architects and engineers to evaluate architectures, identify potential problems, and implement solutions that align with business needs and technical requirements. The Well-Architected Framework consists of six pillars

The mnemonic device for the six pillars is **CROPSS**

**Cost Optimization**

Focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs and ensuring that the system is run in the most cost-effective way possible.

**Reliability**

Focuses on the ability of a system to recover from failures and meet business and customer demand in the event of disruptions.

**Operational Excellence**

Focuses on the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

**Performance Efficiency**

Focuses on the efficient use of computing resources to meet system requirements, and maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

**Security**

Focuses on protecting information and systems with a security mindset at all layers, and following security best practices.

**Sustainability**

Focuses on the ability of a system to operate in an environmentally conscious and responsible manner, with a focus on reducing energy consumption, minimizing carbon footprint, and using renewable resources whenever possible.
