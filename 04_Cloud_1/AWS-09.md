# Shared Responsibility Model
In AWS, the shared responsibility model is a security framework that clarifies the division of responsibilities between AWS and its customers when it comes to securing the cloud environment.

AWS is responsible for the security "of" the cloud, which includes physical infrastructure, networking, and core services such as compute, storage, and database services.

Customers, on the other hand, are responsible for the security "in" the cloud, which includes the security of their data, applications, operating systems, and network configurations.

Think of it like renting a house: AWS is responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the building (roof, walls, plumbing), while customers are responsible for keeping their personal belongings safe and secure (locking doors, windows, setting alarms).
