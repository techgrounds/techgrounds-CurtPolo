### Ervaren problemen
I have no admin access to the network so I am using Cisco Packet Tracer.

### Resultaat
1. To find my public IP address I used https://www.whatismyip.com/ , but also tested out the CLI option command: **"nslookup myip.opendns.com resolver1.opendns.com"**

2. The public IP address of both my phone and laptop are the same because a public IP address is a unique IP address asigned to my network by the ISP (Internet Service Providor). When a device on the network sends data to the internet, the router or modem replaces the private IP address with the public IP address before sending it to the internet.

3. To find my private IP address on my phone and laptop, I used a combination of ipconfig, checking my phone's Wi-Fi settings and seeing it under the IPV4 section or you can also do it by logging in your router and finding the device list.

4. My device's private IP addresses are not the same. They need to be different so they can have their unique identity on the network.
