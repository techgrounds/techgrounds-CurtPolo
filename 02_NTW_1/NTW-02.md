# Network Devices
Network devices are physical or virtual components that are used to facilitate communication and data transfer between computers or other devices on a network. These devices may be hardware or software-based and are designed to provide specific network functions such as routing, switching, forwarding, filtering, or security. 


## Key-terms
**Router**

**Switch**

**Repeaters**

# Network Devices & What They Do
**Router**

Devices that connect multiple networks and direct traffic between them.

**Switch**

Devices that connect devices on a network and enable them to communicate with each other.

**Repeaters**

Devices that amplify and regenerate signals to extend the reach of a network.

**Access Point** 

A networking hardware device that allows wireless devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets, to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi or other wireless communication standards.

**Hubs**

Devices that allow multiple devices to connect to a network and communicate with each other.

**Firewalls**

Devices that protect a network by controlling access to it and blocking unauthorized traffic.

**Load balancers**

Devices that distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and availability.

**Network interface cards (NICs)**

Hardware components that enable devices to connect to a network and communicate with other devices.

**Modems**

Devices that convert digital signals to analog signals for transmission over telephone lines.

**Repeaters**

Devices that amplify and regenerate signals to extend the reach of a network.
