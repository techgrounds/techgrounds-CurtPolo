## Authentication vs Authorization
Authentication and authorization are two different concepts in computer security.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device. It ensures that the person or device accessing a system or application is who or what they claim to be. This is usually done by entering a username and password, or by using biometric information like a fingerprint or face recognition.

Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or actions within a system or application. It determines what a user is allowed to do or access once they have been authenticated. For example, a user who has been authenticated may be authorized to read certain files, but not to modify or delete them.

So, authentication verifies identity, while authorization controls access to resources based on that identity. In other words, authentication is about making sure you are who you say you are, while authorization is about determining what you can and cannot do once you have been identified.

## The Three Factors of Authentication
The three factors of authentication are:

    1. Something you know - this refers to knowledge-based information that only the user should know, such as a password, a PIN, or the answer to a secret question.

    2. Something you have - this refers to a physical object that the user possesses, such as a smart card, a security token, or a mobile device that receives a one-time code.

    3. Something you are - this refers to a biometric characteristic of the user, such as a fingerprint, a facial scan, or an iris scan.


## How Does MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) Improve Security?

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) improves security by adding an additional layer of protection to the authentication process beyond just a username and password. By requiring the user to provide at least two forms of identification, such as a password and a one-time code sent to their mobile device, MFA helps to ensure that only authorized users are able to access a system or application.

The use of MFA can help prevent various types of attacks, including brute force attacks, phishing attacks, and password guessing attacks. If an attacker is able to obtain a user's password, they will still need the additional factor of authentication to gain access to the system. Additionally, MFA can help protect against account takeover attacks, where an attacker attempts to take control of an existing user account by using stolen credentials.

Overall, the use of MFA helps to increase security by adding an extra layer of protection that makes it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and resources.

## The Principle of Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege is a security concept in information technology that advocates granting users the minimum level of access to resources necessary to perform their job functions.

In other words, the principle of least privilege ensures that users are only given the permissions required to perform their specific tasks and no more. By restricting user access to only the resources they need to do their jobs, the principle of least privilege aims to minimize the potential damage caused by accidental or intentional misuse of resources and to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

The principle of least privilege applies to various aspects of IT security, including user accounts, network resources, software applications, and data. By implementing the principle of least privilege, organizations can improve security, prevent data breaches, and reduce the impact of cyber attacks.
