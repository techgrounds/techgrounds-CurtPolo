# Files and Directories
Folders in Linux are called directories. In this task we will be learning how to navigate through the Linux directories using the terminal.

## Key-terms
**Root Directory**

The root directory in Linux is represented by a slash ( / ). The root directory is the parent path to all files on the installation's partition.

**Home Directory**

The home directory in Linux is respresented by a tilde ( ~ ). The Linux home directory is a directory for a particular user of the system and consists of individual files. It is also referred to as the login directory, because it is the first place occurs after you login.

**Relative Path**

Relative path is defined as path related to the present working directory(pwd)

**Absolute Path**

An absolute path is defined as the specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/). In other words we can say absolute path is a complete path from start of actual filesystem from / directory.
